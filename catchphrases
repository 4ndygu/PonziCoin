BitConnect v3?
It Pumps Itself! You just have to dump it.
Like CryptoKitties but with less pretense
We'll never put you on hodl
Bernie Madoff got nothing on us
It's a store of value
Top 5 coin by March, I promise
Because money doesn't grow on trees... unless you're BitFinex
Buy XLM, my college fund is in there
There was no testing done, I'd be surprised if someone didn't steal all the money
Buy High, Sell Low
Yes, this is the next 1,000x coin
Am I the only one VeChain hasn't partnered with?
We accept ETH and LongIslandIcedCoin
